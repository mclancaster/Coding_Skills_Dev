Purpose: JavaFX application that allows user to login to a desired e-mail client, and read / reply.

NOTE: Currently, this application only supports the Gmail server.

<i>To Use:</i> Before attempting to login, you'll need to "<b>Allow less secure apps</b>," which can be turned 'ON' in your Gmail settings. The project itself is a full Eclipse project, and can be loaded-in, and directly run from the IDE as a Java Application.

If you have any comments, concerns, or appropriate outbursts; please let me know.
