# PupperViewer-Web-
Small web-client with a pup-related story!

NOTE: If you are using <b>Google Chrome</b>, You will need to either download a plugin, or start chrome with the proper flags to allow xmlHttpRequests (--allow-file-access-from-files). Without, program will lack functionality.

<i>To Use</i>: The project file is an Eclipse project, and can be run directly from an Eclips IDE that also has web-tools installed. Please note, As this is a Web-Based project, You will need to run this program on some form of local-host server (XAMPP-Apache for example, in the htdocs workspace). Without, Program will not be able to perform server-side operations.

If you have any comments, concerns, or appropriate outbursts; please let me know.
