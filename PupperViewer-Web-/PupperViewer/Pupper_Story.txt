Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess named Flora. She was trapped, and waiting for someone to rescue her. Not just anyone though, she needed a hero! One who would care for her, and not be mean like the captors of her past. All hope was lost...<END>
One day, a man came to Shelter Castle in search of long-lost friends. He looked upon all the puppers with sadness; wishing he could save them. He searched high, he searched low, he searched ‘till it was time to go! As he left, he stumbled upon our princess; trembling at the site of him. “I can’t leave you here” he exclaimed, and shortly after had freed her from captivity!<END>
He brought Flora home to many wonderful things! A delicious bone for chewing...<END>
And a comfy bed for napping!<END>
Our princess was unsure of how to receive such kindness, and feared losing the love she was given. “He can never leave me!” Flora exclaimed. “I’ll be by his side as much as I can!”<END>
 She hogged his bed for sleeping<END>
And then some more for lounging!<END>
She cared for him when he was hurt<END>
And “supported” him in his studies<END>
Sometimes, the man had to leave, and Flora worried if he would ever return! She’d chew on his clothes, his bedsheets, and even his socks! But he was nowhere to be found. When the man finally did come home, Flora was so happy to see him, and showed how hard she looked for him.<END>
The man would get upset, as his socks, and shirts, and sheets were ruined! But he was a kind man, and loved her anyways. Besides, who could be mad at that face!<END>
And so they continue their adventure called life, living happily ever after!<END>
Flora was an abused shelter dog when I found her, and completely closed off to the world. A year later she still chews up my stuff, and I’ve had to decline opportunities that may have been in my interest, but not hers. Even so, I have no regrets in my decisions, and encourage everyone I know to adopt their own pupper prince or princess :D
